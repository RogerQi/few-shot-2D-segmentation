# Repo for CS598ACV class project

This repo is a part of the research project for CS598ACV. In this repo, we explore how cosine-similarity-based
fine-tuning affects the training dynamics of few-shot semantic segmentation.

Set up steps

1. Follow [README for MMSEGMENTATION](./README_ori.md) to set up necessary dependencies
2. Download PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset from [here](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar)
3. Use this [pascal-5i tool](https://github.com/DeepTrial/pascal-5) to prepare few-shot PASCAL-5i set
